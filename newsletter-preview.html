          Editors’ note, Sunday November 30th: We’re no longer updating this article. For the latest pricing, see our guide to the best early Cyber Monday deals. 
Black Friday is technically a thing of the past, but many of the best deals we told you about yesterday — including deep discounts on the AirPods Pro 3, the Pixel Watch 4, and the latest Kindle Paperwhite — are still kicking for now. In some cases, gadgets are out of stock at certain stores, or certain configurations are tougher to find at this point. You don’t have to worry, though, as we’ve confirmed that every deal below is both in stock and selling at a great price.
Below are the results of our weeks spent sifting through deals and continually adding new, noteworthy deals as we come across them. We’re coming to you live once again toda...

          Black Friday is over, but the deals haven’t simply evaporated. As we turn our attention to Cyber Monday, many of our favorite deals are still holding strong. That means you have another chance to save if you’ve been too preoccupied with holiday leftovers. Be forewarned, though: stock on certain items is dwindling, and in some instances, prices are starting to creep back up. The good news is that we’ve vetted the prices and availability of every deal below, so you can shop with confidence.
If you need a place to start, the AirPods 4 are a great pair of starter earbuds, and they’re nearly 50 percent off. Amazon’s base Kindle, meanwhile, is perfect for casual readers, especially given that it’s down to its best price to date. Me? Well, I was overdue for an upgrade, so I picked up an M4 MacBoo...

          Investors have handed billions of dollars to star AI executives, but their startups still face an uphill battle to compete with giants like OpenAI and Google.
Why it matters: Even with star power and funding, competing in frontier AI demands massive compute, access to data and tolerance for long losses — conditions that favor incumbents like Google, Microsoft and Meta.

Driving the news: A number of towering figures in the field have grown dissatisfied with their Big Tech jobs and opted to start up their own ventures.

Meta AI chief scientist Yann LeCun — who has clashed with Meta leadership over research direction — is the latest star heading for the exits. Meta says it plans to partner with LeCun's new startup, which will focus on models with real-world reasoning.

          VentureBeat recently sat down (virtually) with Itamar Golan, co-founder and CEO of Prompt Security, to chat through the GenAI security challenges organizations of all sizes face. 
We talked about shadow AI sprawl, the strategic decisions that led Golan to pursue building a market-leading platform versus competing on features, and a real-world incident that crystallized why protecting AI applications isn't optional anymore. Golan provided an unvarnished view of the company's mission to empower enterprises to adopt AI securely, and how that vision led to SentinelOne's estimated $250 million acquisition in August 2025.
Golan's path to founding Prompt Security began with academic work on transformer architectures, well before they became foundational to today's large language models. His exper...

          This weekend, Andrej Karpathy, the former director of AI at Tesla and a founding member of OpenAI, decided he wanted to read a book. But he did not want to read it alone. He wanted to read it accompanied by a committee of artificial intelligences, each offering its own perspective, critiquing the others, and eventually synthesizing a final answer under the guidance of a "Chairman."
To make this happen, Karpathy wrote what he called a "vibe code project" — a piece of software written quickly, largely by AI assistants, intended for fun rather than function. He posted the result, a repository called "LLM Council," to GitHub with a stark disclaimer: "I’m not going to support it in any way... Code is ephemeral now and libraries are over."

          Hello, dear readers. Happy belated Thanksgiving and Black Friday!
This year has felt like living inside a permanent DevDay. Every week, some lab drops a new model, a new agent framework, or a new “this changes everything” demo. It’s overwhelming. But it’s also the first year I’ve felt like AI is finally diversifying — not just one or two frontier models in the cloud, but a whole ecosystem: open and closed, giant and tiny, Western and Chinese, cloud and local.
So for this Thanksgiving edition, here’s what I’m genuinely thankful for in AI in 2025 — the releases that feel like they’ll matter in 12–24 months, not just during this week’s hype cycle.
1. OpenAI kept shipping strong: GPT-5, GPT-5.1, Atlas, Sora 2 and open weights

          There have been plenty of ominous warnings this year about the job market, trade war-fueled inflation, asset bubbles, and more. The mighty U.S. economy has chugged ahead in 2025 despite them all.
The big picture: There may be cracks in the expansion that is now five years old, and we spend plenty of digital ink in this newsletter chronicling just that. 

But the biggest-picture indicators point to this being one of the better economies of modern times.

1. Unemployment is (still) low. The unemployment rate has been below 4.5% for 47 consecutive months, nearly four years.

That has only happened in one previous era, in data that goes back to 1948 — the four-year periods ending in 1969 and 1970.
The boom times of the late 1980s, the 1990s, and late 2010s never matched this duration of low jo...

          New pricing deals and aggressive marketing are transforming expensive GLP-1 weight-loss drugs into mainstream treatments and creating the next mega-market for the pharmaceutical industry.
Why it matters: Americans have shown they're willing to pay thousands of dollars out of pocket for the treatments — making them more popular than ever even as insurers try to pump the brakes by restricting coverage.

There may be more deals on the way. Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have already reduced prices for the leading GLP-1s in their recent agreement with President Trump in exchange for expanded access to millions of people on Medicare. 
Medical researchers also continue to find promising new medical uses for GLP-1s, including treatment of addiction, COPD and dementia — though not every application ha...
