            <p class="story-preview">Hollywood's biggest competition this year isn't at the box office, it's in the Warner Bros. Discovery boardroom.  
State of play: A trio of Hollywood power players submitted bids to buy all or part of WBD Thursday, launching what is sure to be a dramatic and historic media merger fight. 

Why it matters: In a hyper-competitive streaming environment, scale matters. And assets like WBD, which includes the nation's top-performing movie studio so far this year (Warner Bros. Pictures) and a prestige streamer (HBO Max), don't come up for grabs often. 
Driving the news: WBD's board set a Thursday deadline for takeover bids and received three propositions, sources confirmed to Axios.

            <p class="story-preview">The Emmett Till Interpretive Center has bought a barn outside Drew, Mississippi, where 14-year-old Emmett Till was tortured and killed in 1955.
Why it matters: The purchase of the barn, which has changed private ownership over decades, now secures one of the most significant sites in American civil rights history.

Driving the new: The acquisition ensures the site won't be lost to development or destruction, as many historical locations tied to anti-Black violence have been.

"Our board voted to pay the $1.5 million that was necessary to protect the site," the center said in a statement.
"We chose preservation over risk, and truth over silence — because you can't put a price on our history."

The big picture: The barn is among the most critical physical remnants of Till's murder, a killing...</p>

            <p class="story-preview">The Internal Revenue Service is rolling out Salesforce's AI agent program, Agentforce, in multiple divisions across the agency, per an announcement shared exclusively with Axios.
Why it matters: At a time when the IRS has seen a massive reduction in its workforce due to Trump administration layoffs, it's also using AI agents for the first time.

The IRS workforce has gone down 25% this year, from 100,000 to about 75,000 employees.

Driving the news: The IRS will use Agentforce across the Office of Chief Counsel, Taxpayer Advocate Services and the Office of Appeals, said Paul Tatum, executive vice president of global public sector solutions at Salesforce.

After working with the IRS for a few years to modernize some basic platform technology in those departments, the agency is now bringing ...</p>

            <p class="story-preview">If you add up all of President Trump's plans for the tens of billions in tariff revenue the U.S. is collecting, the bucket of money has already dried up — and then some.
Why it matters: For the first time in decades, America is bringing in meaningful tariff revenue that could improve the nation's fiscal outlook, a bright spot from the administration's trade policy.

But Trump has promised debt reduction, deficit reduction, $2,000 dividend checks and farm bailouts with the money, among other things. All of it would cost hundreds of billions of dollars, if not trillions, more in total than is on track to be collected. 

The big picture: Trump is relying on the money as a source of relief amid an affordability crisis that pinched Republicans in elections earlier this month.

            <p class="story-preview">Investors have handed billions of dollars to star AI executives, but their startups still face an uphill battle to compete with giants like OpenAI and Google.
Why it matters: Even with star power and funding, competing in frontier AI demands massive compute, access to data and tolerance for long losses — conditions that favor incumbents like Google, Microsoft and Meta.

Driving the news: A number of towering figures in the field have grown dissatisfied with their Big Tech jobs and opted to start up their own ventures.

Meta AI chief scientist Yann LeCun — who has clashed with Meta leadership over research direction — is the latest star heading for the exits. Meta says it plans to partner with LeCun's new startup, which will focus on models with real-world reasoning.

            <p class="story-preview">The world's most popular chatbot, ChatGPT, faces new threats from its biggest competitor: Google's Gemini. 
Why it matters: Google was caught on the back foot when OpenAI released ChatGPT three years ago. With the release of, and rave reviews for, Gemini 3 Pro, the script has flipped. 

The big picture: Google's new Gemini 3 model is forcing a reckoning at OpenAI. 

CEO Sam Altman told staffers to brace for "rough vibes" and "temporary economic headwinds" as the company works to catch up, per The Information.
Tech history is full of toppled incumbents — Betamax, AltaVista, MySpace, Friendster — but the AI race moves at a far faster clip. Today's leader could be tomorrow's laggard.
Even before Gemini 3, OpenAI was already confronting declining engagement, Sources.news reported, as content r...</p>

            <p class="story-preview">Data: Bureau of Labor Statistics; Chart: Axios Visuals
For an economy that's rapidly expanding, the usual drivers of job creation sure aren't carrying their weight.
Why it matters: Anemic job growth in key sectors is a sign that there is more underlying weakness in worker demand than the low unemployment rate might suggest.

It makes for a weaker starting point, as companies see new opportunities around the corner to use AI to automate their work.
It's not a new trend: These sectors showed weak job creation or outright job losses for the last couple of years of the Biden administration. 
But it is striking that a GDP surge fueled by data center and AI investment hasn't been enough to generate more robust hiring.

            <p class="story-preview">There have been plenty of ominous warnings this year about the job market, trade war-fueled inflation, asset bubbles, and more. The mighty U.S. economy has chugged ahead in 2025 despite them all.
The big picture: There may be cracks in the expansion that is now five years old, and we spend plenty of digital ink in this newsletter chronicling just that. 

But the biggest-picture indicators point to this being one of the better economies of modern times.

1. Unemployment is (still) low. The unemployment rate has been below 4.5% for 47 consecutive months, nearly four years.

That has only happened in one previous era, in data that goes back to 1948 — the four-year periods ending in 1969 and 1970.
The boom times of the late 1980s, the 1990s, and late 2010s never matched this duration of low jo...</p>

The new model, Claude Opus 4.5, scored higher on Anthropic's most challenging internal engineering assessment than any human job candidate in the company's history, according to materials reviewed by VentureBeat.

            <p class="story-preview">There’s been a lot of talk that AI tools have yet to prove their worth. But if revenue is anything to go by, there's one area where AI tools have undoubtedly provided real returns: software engineering.
The collective revenue generated from AI coding tools like Anysphere’s Cursor and Anthropic’s Claude Code has surpassed $3.1 billion. This includes nearly $400 million in annualized revenue being generated from Cognition’s Devin coding agent, a number that hasn’t been previously reported, according to a person with direct knowledge of Cognition’s financials. (It doesn’t include OpenAI’s Codex, whose revenue isn’t available, so the total is surely higher than $3.1 billion).

This is just a wild guess, to be clear, but it’s based on how Nvidia has responded to past competitive threats—by throwing money at companies to ensure they remain loyal customers and don’t jump to a rival.
As we reported on Monday, Google has been pitching companies such as Meta on using Google’s specialized AI chips.

ByteDance’s fears about a supply crunch were well placed—but when the clampdown came, it wasn’t from Washington. In recent months, Chinese regulators blocked ByteDance from using Nvidia chips in new data centers, according to two ByteDance employees, which means it is sitting on chips it can’t use.</p>
