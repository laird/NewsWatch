                    <p>On Monday, the President signed an executive order laying out his vision for a “Manhattan Project” for AI. The plan calls for the national labs—the Department of Energy-funded research centers—to work together with AI companies to train AI models based on government science data. For instance, it tasks the Secretary of Energy with assessing the computing resources that “industry partners” could provide to the effort.</p><p>That collaboration, along with others in the order, would build on existing relationships between AI companies and their counterparts in universities and national labs.</p><p>For example, earlier this year, system administrators from xAI sought out advice on how to set up data centers from Dr. Dan Stanzione, who runs the Texas Advanced Computing Cluster at the University of Texas, Austin. They talked about “high speed file systems to support AI workloads,” Stanzione said, meaning how multiple servers can efficiently read the same files at the same time.</p>
