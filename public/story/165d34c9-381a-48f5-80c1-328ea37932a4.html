                    <p>To boost ChatGPT revenue, OpenAI is following a playbook enterprise apps Zoom and Slack have used to increase paid users. It’s hooking up most of its  users—which now number more than 800 million—with the free version of the chatbot and then trying to convince their employers to sign enterprisewide subscriptions, said a person with knowledge of the strategy.</p><p>As of July, about 35 million people paid for Plus or Pro subscriptions, which typically cost $20 and $200 a month, respectively, according to a person with knowledge of the figures. At the time, that amounted to 5% of its weekly active users. In five years’ time, OpenAI has projected that about 8.5% of 2.6 billion weekly active users of the chatbot, or 220 million people, will pay for a Plus plan, according to the same person.</p>
