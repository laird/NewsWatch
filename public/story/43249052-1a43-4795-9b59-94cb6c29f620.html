                    <p>There’s been a lot of talk that AI tools have yet to prove their worth. But if revenue is anything to go by, there's one area where AI tools have undoubtedly provided real returns: software engineering.</p><p>The collective revenue generated from AI coding tools like Anysphere’s Cursor and Anthropic’s Claude Code has surpassed $3.1 billion. This includes nearly $400 million in annualized revenue being generated from Cognition’s Devin coding agent, a number that hasn’t been previously reported, according to a person with direct knowledge of Cognition’s financials. (It doesn’t include OpenAI’s Codex, whose revenue isn’t available, so the total is surely higher than $3.1 billion).</p><p>To be fair, $3 billion is still a small chunk of the $150 billion-plus that software engineers globally are estimated to be paid. But let’s not forget, none of these tools existed three years ago. And that figure is rapidly growing. Anysphere’s annualized revenue, for instance, has increased to more than $1 billion from $200 million in March. Meanwhile, since Cognition acquired coding tool Windsurf this summer, its annualized revenue is up more than 150%.</p>
