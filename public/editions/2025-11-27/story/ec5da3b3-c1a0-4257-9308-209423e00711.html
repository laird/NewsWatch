                    <p>Investors have handed billions of dollars to star AI executives, but their startups still face an uphill battle to compete with giants like OpenAI and Google.</p><p>Why it matters: Even with star power and funding, competing in frontier AI demands massive compute, access to data and tolerance for long losses — conditions that favor incumbents like Google, Microsoft and Meta.</p><p></p><p>Driving the news: A number of towering figures in the field have grown dissatisfied with their Big Tech jobs and opted to start up their own ventures.</p><p></p><p>Meta AI chief scientist Yann LeCun — who has clashed with Meta leadership over research direction — is the latest star heading for the exits. Meta says it plans to partner with LeCun's new startup, which will focus on models with real-world reasoning.</p><p></p><p>Catch up quick: Former OpenAI executive Ilya Sutskever departed the ChatGPT maker in May 2024, after the failed ouster of Sam Altman, establishing Safe Superintelligence last June and raising more than $1 billion in funding.</p><p></p><p>Mira Murati — briefly named OpenAI CEO — left the company in September 2024 and this year announced her new venture, Thinking Machines Lab. </p><p>Former Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos earlier this month named himself co-CEO and backer of Project Prometheus, an AI startup focused on using AI to improve manufacturing of cars, spacecraft and other hardware. </p><p></p><p>The intrigue: Even Anthropic was founded by former OpenAI executives, though it's now far more developed than the newer startups. </p><p></p><p>It's projecting a $9 billion annual revenue run rate by year's end and has sizable investments from Google and Amazon, plus another $15 billion more in newly announced funding from Microsoft and Nvidia.</p><p></p><p>Zoom in: There are several less well known startups led by OpenAI alums that have raised significant funding.</p><p></p><p>Worktrace AI, which aims to automate business operations by observing human workers in action, is led by Angela Jiang, an early OpenAI product manager. </p><p>It has funding from a variety of investors, including Murati, ChatGPT head Nick Turley and company strategy chief Jason Kwon. </p><p>Periodic Labs, a well-funded AI-for-science startup, is led by former OpenAI researcher William Fedus. </p><p></p><p>Between the lines: Many of these breakaway startups are focusing on areas they feel have been neglected, from AI safety to human centricity to real-world understanding.</p><p></p><p>The OpenAI board fight and Anthropic's founding both stemmed from disagreements over safety, including how quickly to push frontier models into the world. </p><p></p><p>The big picture: It's early innings in the race for AI superintelligence, but it's already clear that even the smartest approach won't work without billions — if not trillions — of dollars in infrastructure.</p><p></p><p>Training a frontier-sized model today can cost hundreds of millions of dollars and could soon approach $1 billion. Nvidia sold more than $50 billion in data center chips last quarter, another reminder of just how capital intensive this business is.</p><p>Some analysts even suspect OpenAI could face a cash squeeze, given that it may need to borrow while Google, Meta and Microsoft can rely on massive cash flows to fund their AI investments.</p><p></p><p>What we're watching: Promising startups that lack resources could ultimately be acquired by the giants, who have the money, infrastructure and incentive to bring former employees' ideas back in-house.</p>
