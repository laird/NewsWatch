Please implement a fix for GitHub issue #16: Fix story categorization - all stories incorrectly tagged as SaaS

Issue Details:
## Problem
Currently, most/all stories are being categorized as 'SaaS', which is incorrect. The current categorization logic is too simplistic and doesn't accurately reflect the diversity of software economy news.

## Current Implementation
The `extractSectors` function in `backend/services/peAnalysis.js` uses basic regex matching:
```javascript
const sectorKeywords = {
    'SaaS': /\b(saas|software as a service|cloud software)\b/i,
    'FinTech': /\b(fintech|financial technology|payments?|banking)\b/i,
    'HealthTech': /\b(healthtech|health|medical|biotech|pharma)\b/i,
    'E-commerce': /\b(ecommerce|e-commerce|retail|marketplace)\b/i,
    'AI/ML': /\b(ai|artificial intelligence|machine learning|ml)\b/i,
    'Enterprise': /\b(enterprise|b2b|business software)\b/i
};
```

## Proposed Solution

### 1. Define Better Categories
Create a comprehensive set of categories relevant to software economy news:
- **Business Model**: SaaS, Platform, Marketplace, Infrastructure, API/Developer Tools
- **Industry Vertical**: FinTech, HealthTech, EdTech, PropTech, LegalTech, Supply Chain, Cybersecurity
- **Technology**: AI/ML, Cloud, Blockchain/Crypto, DevOps, Data/Analytics
- **Stage/Activity**: M&A, Funding, IPO, Product Launch, Partnership, Regulatory
- **Customer Type**: B2B, B2C, Enterprise, SMB

### 2. Use AI for Categorization
Instead of regex matching, ask the AI to categorize stories during the PE analysis:

**Updated Prompt Addition**:
```
For categorization, analyze the story and assign 1-3 category tags that best describe it.
Choose from these categories:

Business Models: SaaS, Platform, Marketplace, Infrastructure, API/Developer Tools, Open Source
Verticals: FinTech, HealthTech, EdTech, PropTech, LegalTech, Supply Chain, Cybersecurity, Media/Content, Gaming
Technology: AI/ML, Cloud Computing, Blockchain/Crypto, DevOps/Infrastructure, Data/Analytics, IoT, AR/VR
Activity Type: M&A/Acquisition, Funding Round, IPO/Public Markets, Product Launch, Partnership, Regulatory/Policy
Customer Segment: Enterprise, SMB, Consumer, Developer Tools

Return the categories as an array in the `categories` field (not `sectors`).
```

### 3. Update Database Schema
- Rename `pe_analysis.sectors` to `pe_analysis.categories` for clarity
- Migrate existing data

## Files to Modify
- `backend/services/peAnalysis.js` - Update AI prompt and response parsing
- `backend/services/scoring.js` - Use `categories` instead of `sectors`
- `backend/services/newsletter.js` - Display categories correctly

- Personal/Community Scoring (Issue #11) depends on accurate categories

Please:
1. Analyze the issue and understand what needs to be changed
2. Update the PE analysis prompt to use AI-based categorization
3. Update the extractSectors function or replace it
4. Update all references from 'sectors' to 'categories'
5. Test with a few sample stories to verify improved categorization
6. Ensure the code follows best practices

After completing the work, please summarize what was done.
